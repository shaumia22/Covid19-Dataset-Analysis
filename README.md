# COVID-19 Case Analysis with Power BI

## About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing a COVID-19 dataset using Power BI to gain insights into case distributions across continents and countries. The dataset includes information such as total case count, median age, and new case counts.

## Purpose of the Project
* The purpose of this project is to:
* Understand Global Impact: Identify which countries have the highest COVID-19 case counts
* Explore Demographic Trends: Examine correlations between median age and case numbers
* Visualize Data Effectively: Utilize Power BI to create dashboards that make trends more accessible
* Data Cleaning & Structuring: Use powerBI query to refine the dataset before analysis
* Gain Analytical Skills: Develop Power BI expertise while working with real-world data

## Dataset Information
Columns:
* Country & Continent: Identifies geographic locations for reported cases
* Total Case Count: The cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country/continent
* Median Age: Represents the median age of the population
* New Case Count: Tracks recent cases, allowing for trend analysis and peak identification.

## Cleaning Process:
* Columns with significant amount of NULL values were removed
* Rows with NULL values in any of the above listed columns were filtered out
* Countries column also consisted of regions and hence those were filtered out

## Features & Visualizations
* Case Distribution: Pie charts showing total case counts by continent for the top 5 covid19 total case countries
* Trend Analysis: Line charts tracking case spikes over time for the top 5 covid19 total case countries
* Demographic Insights: Exploring correlations between age and case numbers
* Geospatial Mapping: Visualization of global case density

## How to Use
1. Download the Power BI file in .pbix format
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop
3. Interact with filters and visuals to explore insights
